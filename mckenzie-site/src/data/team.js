    bio: "I see life experiences as seeds - some big, some small, some uncomfortable, oddly shaped, smooth; the names of these seeds could be joy, pain, flux, transition, grief, or trauma. As we begin to collect seeds they take up space. Learning how to plant those seeds, foster and care for them, can possibly allow them to bloom. Through telling your story, the good and the not so great, it is my hope as a therapist to help provide the tools you need to sow your own garden. As an integrative therapist I rely on a person-centered approach and utilize methods like Motivational Interviewing, Family Systems theory, and Narrative therapy in my sessions. I also pull from my Gottman Level 1 Couples Certification and my Trauma Informed Yoga Certification when working with my clients.",
